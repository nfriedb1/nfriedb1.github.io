	<h1>About</h1>
	<h3>Motivation</h3>
	<p>I believe that climate change is the defining issue of our time, and that working to mitigate the temperature increase and the resulting ecosystem disasters such as extreme heat and flooding will allow humans to lead better lives for generations to come.
	<h3>Education</h3>
	<p>I graduated with a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in French from Purdue University in 2020, with a minor in Environmental Politics & Policy. From there, I enrolled at Johns Hopkins, where I am working on my <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/academics/scm-in-environmental-health">ScM in Environmental Health.</a> My thesis is titled "Evaluation of a low-cost sensor used to examine CO2 urban gradients," and my advisor is Dr. Kirsten Koehler.</p>
	<h3>Future Goals</h3>
	<p>After I complete my Master's degree, I hope to work in an interdisciplinary setting where I can combine my interests in climate change and air pollution issues, and utilize both my quantitative skills and knowledge of environmental policy.</p>
